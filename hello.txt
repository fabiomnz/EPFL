I am a professional with a background in technology law, currently expanding my expertise into data analytics and data science. I recently completed my master's thesis, which focused on developing a data protection model and analyzing information risk. As part of my academic journey, I am now pursuing postgraduate studies at the University of Cambridge, where I am acquiring technical skills in data analysis and programming for the first time. My goal is to bridge the gap between legal frameworks, emerging technologies, and data-driven solutions.
