I am a professional with a background in technology law, currently expanding my expertise into data analytics and data science. I recently completed my master's thesis, which focused on developing a data protection model and analyzing information risk. As part of my academic journey, I am now pursuing postgraduate studies at the University of Cambridge, where I am acquiring technical skills in data analysis and programming for the first time. My goal is to bridge the gap between legal frameworks, emerging technologies, and data-driven solutions.

I aim to acquire and master these technical skills to shape my profile as a hybrid professional in the information technology sector. By completing this program, I hope to integrate data analytics, programming, and machine learning with my background in technology law, enabling me to address complex challenges at the intersection of data governance, risk management, and AI regulation. Ultimately, my goal is to start my professional career in Switzerland, where I can contribute to innovative projects that require both technical expertise and a deep understanding of legal frameworks in the digital landscape.
